## Verified users grew their follower base?
Based on the data that we've collected and analised, we can see that the "group" of verified users that grew the most were the ones that deals with news, like `CNN` or `APBNews`. That makes sense, since the pandemic period made people want to learn more about this critical period and how they could protect themselves, as well as government announcements and general data about the pandemic, such as the number of infected and dead. The image below shows the top 20 verified users that grew the most. The `is_active` column indicates if the user belongs to the most 1000 active users.

As we can see, 6 of the 20 users that most grew are active. Considering that we only consider a user as `active` if he's on the top 1000 that most posted tweets, it seems that exists a correlation between posting more and gain more followers. Even so, that is not a thumb rule, and we need to consider another variables when trying to analysing more deeply the followers number.
